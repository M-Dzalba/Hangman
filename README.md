# Hangman
A console game.
Application functionality and console interface menu:

1. When starting, the application prompts you to start a new game or exit the application.
2. When starting a new game, a word is randomly guessed and the player begins the process of guessing it.
3. After each letter entered, an error counter is displayed in the console, the current state of the gallows (drawn in ASCII characters)
4. Upon completion of the game, the result is displayed (victory or defeat) and we return to state #1 - a proposal to start a new game or exit the application
